Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple
CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.
Easy installation
Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run
out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Linux, macOS and other
Unix-like operating systems.
Easy configuration
Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface,
which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help.
Plugins
With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates
with practically every tool in the continuous integration and
continuous delivery toolchain.
Extensible
Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing
nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do.
Distributed
Jenkins can easily distribute work across multiple machines,
helping drive builds, tests and deployments across multiple
platforms faster.

3 Cases: Jenkins success stories from the community
Back in April, when we started canvassing the Jenkins community for user stories concerning how Jenkins helped enterprise companies, startups, and students, we thought we&#8217;d see some exciting tales of DevOps inspiration and CI/CD integration. We found that some submitted stories were far too big to be constrained by our format of 'background/goal/solution/results.'
Some Jenkins users had a much more complex story to tell, whether...

Jenkins 2.264+: Major changes in the weekly release line
Recently we have selected Jenkins 2.263 as a new baseline for the LTS release line, with ETA in December 2020.
It allows delivering significant and in some cases breaking changes which have been previously on hold.
Beginning with the Jenkins 2.264 release on October 27, 2020, we&#8217;ve entered a period where the Jenkins weekly releases will include more significant changes than usual.
That period of more significant...

Spring and XStream updates (breaking changes!)
Cleaning up technical debt is a perennial topic among Jenkins core developers,
and one of the most visible issues is the use of obsolete and/or forked third-party libraries.
In a world where Dependabot is offering updates to libraries released just hours before,
it is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.
Since large organizations in particular are unhappy to install software using obsolete or...
